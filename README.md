# NSL
Exercises completed during the Numerical Simulation Laboratory course. Each directory contains a different exercise, complete with C++ code (except ex. 11 and 12) and a jupyter notebook which shows the results.

To compile the C++ codes, simply open a terminal, navigate to the desired directory, and run:

`make`

Or, to directly run the code:

`make run`
